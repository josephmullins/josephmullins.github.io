I'm an Assistant Professor of Economics at the University of Minnesota and a consultant at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis Opportunity and Inclusive Growth Institute. My [research focuses](/other/research_statement.pdf) on inequality in the labor market and the economics of child development. 

I recently gave a keynote talk, ["What's next for the economics of child development?"](/slides/mullins_keynote_ozmac.qmd), in which I lay out some of our progress in this field and outline future directions for research.


Find my [research](research.qmd) here and [my CV here](Mullins_CV.pdf). I teach [three classes](teaching.qmd) periodically.
