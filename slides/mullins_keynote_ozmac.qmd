## Intro

:::{.incremental}
- You invited me for a keynote and it went to my head **immediately**
- I want to do something extremely pretentious: set an agenda for this field
- Try to convince you that:
  1. We've made good progress; and 
  2. That there is much more exciting work to do (**especially in Macro**)
- Full disclosure: this is coming from someone who spends 90% of his time screaming at a computer
:::

## A Research Program that Stands on Two Facts

:::{.incremental}
1. Most life-cycle inequality can be explained by **pre-labor market factors** (e.g. @keane_career_1997, @huggett_sources_2011)
2. These **skills** and **traits** are partly shaped by environment, hence malleable to policy
:::

. . .

The evidence suggests several key windows of opportunity in which to make equitable *and* efficient investments in human capital

## Outline:

:::{.incremental}
- Review the evidence
- @becker_equilibrium_1979: an easily extendable prototype model
- Applications of the framework
- Where to next?

# Evidence on the childhood origins of inequality

## Summary {.smaller}

Four categories

:::{.incremental}
1. Experimental evidence on primates and other mammals (too large, won't cover)
    - Effect of deprivation/nurturing on grey matter, spinal dendritic density, neuroendocrine system, gene expression [@grantham-mcgregor_developmental_2007]
2. Early childhood education (experimental)
    - Perry [@heckman_rate_2010], ABC / CARES [@garcia_quantifying_2020]
3. Home visiting programs (experimental)
    - e.g. Colombia [@attanasio_using_2014], Jamaica, [@gertler_labor_2014], India [@andrew_effects_2020]
4. Public investments (quasi-experimental)
    - Medicaid [@goodman-bacon_long-run_2021], Head Start [@bailey_prep_2021], Food Stamps [@bailey_is_2024], Child Tax Credit [@barr_investing_2022], Moving to Opportunity [@chetty_impacts_2018]

## slide

Poverty and environmental deprivation disrupt children’s early
brain development during periods of neural plasticity and sensitivity to
environmental interactions, leading to long-term negative consequences on
children’s health and development. The effects of poverty on the
developing brain are mediated by caregiving behavior and stressful experiences, 
illustrating the powerful potential of responsive caregiving. -->


# The Becker Framework

## The Becker Framework {.smaller}

:::{.incremental}
- Human capital produced with investments 
    - @becker_treatise_2010, @becker_equilibrium_1979
    $$ \theta_{t+1} = f(\theta_{t},I_{t}) $$
    - $t$ can index generations or periods of development
- Consistent with large literature on human development [@cunha_technology_2007]
- Quantitatively, $\theta$ and $I$ may be substitutes in early life [@cunha_estimating_2010]
- These periods of developmental sensitivity are windows of opportunity for public investment
- Bypass equity-efficiency tradeoffs that appear later in life [@cunha_technology_2007]
:::

## The Model {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

::: {.fragment .fade-right}

- Generations indexed by $t$
- Endowments, $y$, a function of skills, $\theta$
- Investment, $I$
- A one period bond, $A$
- The technology: $\theta_{t+1} = f(\theta_{t},I_{t})$

:::

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

::: {.fragment .fade-left}

Recursive formulation:
  $$ V(A,\theta) = \max_{I,C,A}\left\{u(C) + \beta V(A',\theta') \right\} $$
s.t. 
$$ C + pI + A' \leq y(\theta) + A(1+r) $$
$$ A' \geq 0 $$

:::

:::

::::

::: {.fragment .fade-up}

Note:

- $C$ and $I$ can be composite goods e.g. time and money [@del_boca_household_2014]
- can extend to multiple skills, periods of investment, inputs

:::

## Application: Incomplete Markets

:::{.incremental}
- If $A'\geq0$ not a constraint, **returns on $I$ and $A$ are equal**
    - $f_{2}(\theta, I) = (1+r)$ $\Rightarrow$ no role for endowments
- Market incompleteness is therefore **key** for understanding data and providing a role for policy
- Uninsured income risk also distorts timing of investments
- Quantitatively, binding constraints in any period matter for all periods [@caucutt_early_2020]
- Age-dependent transfers that resolve these inefficiencies $\approx$ 5\% cev [@abbott_incomplete_2022]
:::

## Application: Designing Cash Transfers [@mullins_designing_2022] {.smaller}

Consider a non-linear tax problem a la @diamond_income_1980:

- A planner choosing income $y(e)$ for all earnings $e$
- Households of type $e$ choosing $\{0,e\}$

. . .

A marginal increase in $y(e)$...

## Application: Designing Cash Transfers [@mullins_designing_2022] {.smaller}

:::{.incremental}
- To quantify the mechanism, estimate a dynamic model of work, program participation and investment in children
- Factor shares of **time** and **money** inputs play crucial  and intuitive role in planner's problem
- $\delta_{x}\ \uparrow$ program more generous
- $\delta_{\tau}/\delta_{x}\ \uparrow$ fewer work subsidies
- Estimate the model on single mothers with **rich unobserved heterogeneity** in labor market productivity, work costs and program participation costs.
- Use welfare reform and EITC expansions to form instruments for $\delta_{x}$ and $\delta_{\tau}$
- An optimal program is 20-25\% more generous than US baseline in 2000

## Application: Direct Public Investment

## Application: Direct Public Investment {.smaller}

:::{.incremental}
- @daruich_macroeconomic_2023 models this intervention as a **direct monetary investment** equal to the cost of the program
    - using @cunha_estimating_2010 estimates
- this seems to work remarkably well (gets close to the treatment impact on earnings)
- even seems to match the impact on "scaled up" programs (Head Start)
- large welfare gains: 12\% cev in long-run
- a key source: dynamic complementarity **across generations**
- evidence is more scant on some of the major components of the mechanism

# What's Next?

## Looking ahead

1. Credibility
2. Widening scope
    - Inputs and Outputs
    - Mechanism behind returns

## Credibility: An example {.smaller}

Suppose that a key piece of the model is:

$$ \theta_{t+1} = z [\alpha I^\rho + (1-\alpha)\theta_{t}^\rho]^{1/\rho} $$

with $I = x^{\delta}\tau^{1-\delta}$.

. . .

A common strategy in Macro:

:::{.incremental}
1. Calibrate model to *cross-sectional* moments
    - e.g. Match average test scores by age of child and by parental income, average expenditures on children (CEX), average time inputs (ATUS)
    - identificiation via CRS assumption
    - assuming away confounding sources of heterogeneity (e.g. correlation between wages/preferences and $z$)

2. Validate the model by replicating a known research design inside the model
    - e.g. "Person, Guy \& Fellah (2014) find that a 10\% increase in income for population $X$ leads to a 5\% increase in test scores. We simulate a 10\% income increase in income and find that it results in a 6\% increase in test scores, which validates a key quantitative mechanism in our model."
:::

## Credibility {.smaller}

:::{.incremental}
- I wrote this slide because I wanted to complain about this practice, but I came around as I wrote it down...
- The good:
    - We are seeing more and more of these types of validation exercises
    - It adds credibility while keeping the model accountable to first order features of the data
:::

## Credibility {.smaller}

The bad:
:::{.incremental}
- How close is good enough? Is 5\% vs 6\% big or small? It depends on the calculation.
    - Delta method: $\text{sd}(g(\beta)) = |g\prime(\beta)|\text{sd}(\beta)$
- How much uncertainty does this uncertain number add to your calculation?
- Often, little to no discipline on mechanisms that really matter [@brown_family_2024]
- Subject to cherry-picking
- Treats evidence as an afterthought, rather than a key piece of the exercise
- Why not hold models accountable to as much evidence as possible in a more rigorous way?
:::

## Example: @mullins_designing_2022 {.smaller}

Model produces a linear outcome equation:

$$ \log(\theta_{i,t+1}) = \mu_{k(i)} + \delta_{x}\log\left(\text{net income}_{i,t}\right) + \delta_{\tau}\log\left(\text{non-market time}_{i,t}\right) + \varepsilon_{i,t} $$

. . .

Two strategies:

- Uses policy variation across states and over time to form instruments
- Use panel data to invert out type $k(i)$ and control directly for sources of endogeneity
- Estimate both with GMM and compare

## Example: @mullins_structural_2024

- Build on the dynamic model of @mullins_designing_2022
- Use it to aggregate evidence from 3 welfare reform experiments across 6 sites 
- Experimental welfare programs differed in their use of (1) benefit formulae; (2) time limits; (3) work requirements; (4) childcare subsidies
- Use model to make sense of differences in treatment effects on child outcomes, work, and welfare participation
- Call this a *structural meta-analysis*.

## Figures from @mullins_structural_2024

## Well-articulated variation {.smaller}


:::{.incremental}
- Say that a source of variation is *well-articulated* inside the model if it can be replicated in an *a priori* known way
- Best example: known changes to prices or endowments in the model
    - Benefit formulae, childcare subsidies, and time limits are all well-articulated
    - Work requirements are not (must be parameterized and estimated)
- Any model can be held accountable to empirical evidence that is well-articulated
- A structural meta-analysis begins by identifying all sources of evidence that are well-articulated inside the model
- Models are well-suited to the task of rigorously aggregating evidence!

- Model-based work has focused on:
  - mainly cognitive and limited non-cognitive skills
- Long-run focus on income only
- Skills matter for much more than the labor market...
    - Physical and mental health
    - Crime
    - Pro-social attitudes and behaviors
    - Creativity and invention
- We severely underestimate the returns to intervention when we focus on the labor market returns

## Expanding Inputs [@caucutt_child_2024]

:::{.incremental}
- We extend the basic framework to allow for (1) time; (2) money; and (3) childcare

- Key difference with @cunha_estimating_2010: investments with measurable prices, known relationship to endowments
- Use input demand to estimate elasticities of substitution

## The many dimensions of intelligence {.smaller}

![](figures/brain_dev.jpg){fig-align="center"}
*Source: @grantham-mcgregor_developmental_2007*

## The many dimensions of intelligence {.smaller}

Researchers have identified many unique dimensions of intelligence through measurement and imaging:

1. Crystallized vs fluid
2. Working memory and processing speed
3. Executive functioning: inhibition, task-switching, updating
4. Socio-emotional: systems for processing social information and emotional signals
5. Domainn-specific: language, spatial processing, numerical computation

. . .

The co-evolution of many skills can:

- Help explain fadeout + long-run impacts in ECE programs
- Complicate the comparison of studies with different measures of cognitive skills
- Complicate extrapolation of short-run skill impacts to long-run effects
    - e.g. @kline_evaluating_2016
    - for teacher VA (@gilraine_making_2021, @lavy_alternative_2024)

# Personality and the Life-cycle {.smaller}

![](figures/Big5Outcomes.png)
*Source* @todd_dynamic_2020, estimated on HILDA data

## Personality presents new opportunities and new challenges

:::{.incremental}
- The returns to personality are unlikely to be fundamentally technological
- Shaped by social norms and organization of production
    - extreme example: language
- Important to understand the mechanisms behind and identify policy invariant relationships
    - e.g. multiple equilibria in the organization of production
    - the returns to personality differ across countries, controlling for industry (e.g. Germany vs Australia)
:::

## Toward a better understanding of returns

:::{.incremental}
- Quantitative policy studies focus on *labor market earnings*
    - straightforward in competitive markets
    - less so, otherwise!
    - not policy invariant
- Empirical work emphasises health, crime, happiness
- None are truly invariant!
- Industrial composition
- Endogenous technological choices
- Organization of production
- Assignment to tasks
:::

## Conclusions

TBA

<!-- ## Conclusion

- We can't predict the future
- But we can't wait 30-50 years to examine the long-run impacts of our experiments
- Have to meet in the middle in ways that account for uncertainties of technology and social organization

## Conclusion

- Lots of focus
- How do we deal with all this complexity?
